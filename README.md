# brentlabRnaSeqTools

This is a very helpful tutorial on making an R package:

# Installation  
In R, do the following:  

```
library(devtools)
library(devtools)

install_github("cmatKhan/brentlabRnaSeqTools")
library(brentlabRnaSeqTools)
```
You will then have the functions in the R subdirectory (see the code repository). Each has a description at the top, and more documentation is on its way.
