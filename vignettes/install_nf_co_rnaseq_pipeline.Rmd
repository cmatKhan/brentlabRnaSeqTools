# Create an environment with nextflow

```{bash}
cd /scratch/mblab/$USER

# launch an interactive session
srun --mem=20000 --cpus-per-task=1 -J interactive -p interactive --pty /bin/bash -l

# note: there are no promises that this package works. My suggestion is that you use your own installation of conda
ml miniconda

mkdir conda_envs

# this will create the environment directory in your scratch space (yes, it may be deleted. you'd have to make a new one when that happens), and installs nextflow into it
create create -p conda_envs/nextflow nextflow

```

# Launch the environment and test nextflow

_Not_ with `conda activate nextflow`. Because you created this outside of your `$CONDA_HOME`, you have to provide the path like so:

```{bash}

# do this if you are not already there
cd /scratch/mblab/$USER
srun --mem=20000 --cpus-per-task=1 -J interactive -p interactive --pty /bin/bash -l
ml miniconda


# activate the environment
source activate ./conda_envs/nextflow

nextflow run hello # note: might take a few minutes
```

# Download the configuration files

You could put this in `$HOME`, if you want, to avoid having it garbage collected

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/cmatKhan/configs.git
```

In the submission to nextflow, you will use one of the configurations in the
subdirectory /conf of the repository above. Eventually this may be merged into
the main fork of the configs repository, at which point you would just include
the argument `-p wustl_htcf` in your nextflow command
